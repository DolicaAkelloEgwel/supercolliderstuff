## Sound

### Patterns, Noise, Periods

Types of Waves:
Clear pattern: Periodic  
"Complex" pattern.  
No pattern: Aperiodic  

![](./patterntypes.png)

Sounds that have a periodic pattern are heard more or less (to the same degree as the clarity of the pattern) as pitch. The clearer the pattern, the clearer the character of the pitch. The absence of pattern approaches noise. In electronic music and synthesis terms, *noise is a wave with no apparent pattern.*  

The number of times the wave moves through its period in one second is the frequency of the wave, expressed in hertz or cycles.

### Properties of Sounds

The speed of a sound depends on temperature, altitude, and air density. For this text, <ins>1000 feet per second will be used.</ins>  

Wave length and speed are important for understanding echo and reverb, phase cancellation, as well as proper microphone and speaker placement.
